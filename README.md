# Bookezy
Welcome to Bookezy our railway reservation website, where booking train tickets has never been easier. Our platform offers a simple and efficient way for users to book tickets online, while also providing station masters with the tools they need to effectively manage their stations. With the added capability for admins to easily add new stations and station masters, our website offers a comprehensive solution for all your railway reservation needs. This project was built for a hackathon named Bhilai Hacks by our team named EntityðŸ’ª

~~Click on this URL https://bookezy.herokuapp.com/ and let me know how it is. Cheers!~~  
Since Heroku took down the free hosting service, the site is no longer hosted anywhere.

## Steps to run the application
1. Clone this repo into your local machine and open it using VS code or any other editor of your choice.
2. Open the terminal and create a virtual environment using the command "python -m venv yourenvname".
3. Activate the virtual env created using the command "yourenvname\Scripts\activate".
4. Once activated, install all the packages using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".
5. Once all packages are installed you are ready to run the application. Type 'py app.py' in the terminal and hit enter.
6. A link like http://127.0.0.1:9876/ will pop up in the terminal. Press Ctrl and click on the link to open it in the browser to see the landing page of the application.
7. Note! Since we are using SQLite for database management you need to uncomment line 142 in app.py the first time you run the command "py app.py" so that the tables are created. Comment the line once the tables are created so that new tables are not created again and again whenever you perform an action.
